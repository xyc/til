# Replaced Element
[MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element)

A replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.

Typical replaced elements:
- `<iframe>`
- `<video>`
- `<embed>`
- `<img>`

Objects inserted using the CSS `content` property are *anonymous replaced elements*.
