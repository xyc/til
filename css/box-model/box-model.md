# Box Model

[MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#content)

## `top`
- `position: absolute | fixed`: This property specifies how far an **absolutely** positioned box's **top margin edge is offset below the top edge of the box's containing block**.
- `position: relative`: For **relatively** positioned boxes, the offset is with respect to the **top edges of the box itself** (i.e., the box is given a position in the normal flow, then offset from that position according to these properties).

## `right`
Like 'top', but specifies how far a box's right margin edge is offset to the left of the right edge of the box's containing block. For relatively positioned boxes, the offset is with respect to the right edge of the box itself.

## `bottom`
Like 'top', but specifies how far a box's bottom margin edge is offset above the bottom of the box's containing block. For relatively positioned boxes, the offset is with respect to the bottom edge of the box itself.

## `right`
Like 'top', but specifies how far a box's left margin edge is offset to the right of the left edge of the box's containing block. For relatively positioned boxes, the offset is with respect to the left edge of the box itself.
