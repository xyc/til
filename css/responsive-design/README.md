## Design thinking
Find one example of a site you use that does responsive design well. Take screenshots of the layout with different screen dimensions (simply resize your browser by dragging on the window to see it in different sizes), and think about: what does this site do well in various contexts? What do they miss out on?

Find an example of a site that doesn't have a great responsive experience. What frustrates you about it? What do you wish you were able to do on mobile?
