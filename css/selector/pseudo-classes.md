#[Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected.

```css
:active
:any
:checked
:default
:dir()
:disabled
:empty
:enabled
:first

:fullscreen
:focus
:hover
:indeterminate
:in-range
:invalid
:lang()

:left
:link
:not()

:optional
:out-of-range
:read-only
:read-write
:required
:right
:root
:scope
:target
:valid
:visited
```

```css
:first-child
:first-of-type
:last-child
:last-of-type
:nth-child(an + b) /* Difference with :nth-of-type: Need to be the exact nth child of parent, while :nth-of-type counts the same type of elements. */
:nth-last-child()
:nth-last-of-type()
:nth-of-type(an + b)
:only-child
:only-of-type
```
